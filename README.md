# Hi, I'm Alina 👋  

**"Where structure meets curiosity - that’s where insights are born."**

I'm a data analyst with a background in business operations and people management.  
As a former team lead, I always wanted to understand how to make better decisions using data.  
This curiosity eventually grew into a new profession: I completed the TripleTen Data Analytics program, now use analytics to answer real business questions.

I’m currently seeking a full-time Data Analyst role (remote or onsite in Israel).

### 🌱 About me
- Based in Israel 🇮🇱  
- I enjoy working with numbers, designing systems, and turning chaos into structure  
- Sometimes I dive so deep into analysis that I need to remind myself to step back and look at the bigger picture  
- **Attention to detail is important, but I believe real impact comes from delivering value, not endless polishing. Sometimes 'good enough' is what moves the business forward.**  
- Calm, understanding, systematic - yet always driven by curiosity
